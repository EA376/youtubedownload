1
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.320
The day has finally arrived for the
investiture of the Victoria Cross.

2
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.600
And Corporal Willie Apiata has been
joined by members of his family for
the monumental occasion.

3
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.120
It was really great that my family
could come down and experience that
with me.

4
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.640
It's the first time we ever
got all of my family on a plane.

5
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.760
My mum's never flown. My two
older sisters have never flown.

6
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.800
I wanna come with you.

7
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.680
You know Daddy'll be
there waiting for you, eh.

8
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.720
Give us a kiss. Eh?

9
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:55.600
Willie's journey to Government House
will take only 15 minutes, but it's
a day three years in the making.

10
00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:03.000
The unit, at the time, raised a
recommendation and arrived at the
Chief of Defence Force's office.

11
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.640
The recommendation went to the
offices of the Prime Minister,
where previous awards were compared.

12
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.680
It was then pushed further,
to Buckingham Palace.

13
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.080
Dates, events and actions were
rigorously checked, double-checked
and checked again.

14
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.160
As such, they then recommended to
the Queen that maybe Willie should
be considered for a Victoria Cross.

15
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.720
In 1857, Queen Victoria awarded the
first Victoria Cross. Today, Willie
will receive a bronze medal cast

16
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.640
from the same cannon metal
dating back to the Crimean War.

17
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.560
Good luck, mate.
Thank you, sir.

18
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.840
It's all sort of
coming home to roost?
Yep. I'm there.

19
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.760
< Make no apologies, but...
(LAUGHS) Nah, it's no worries.

20
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.640
While other distinguished
guests arrive,

21
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.600
Willie catches up with other
personnel who will be decorated
for their acts of bravery.

22
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.320
We know what happened that day, and
no words really have to be spoken.

23
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.840
Good to see you, mate. How's
everything been? Are you managing?

24
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.960
Yeah. Managing, mate.

25
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.600
I thought you did a great job on TV.
I mean, it would have been bloody
shit...

26
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.240
I was in Australia and I saw him.

27
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.000
They had to tell you to shut up (!)
(LAUGHS)

28
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.440
Here you go, Daddy's
gonna put you down now, OK?

29
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.880
Yeah.
Cos you're heavy. You're a big boy.

30
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.680
I'm not a big boy. I'm a little boy.

31
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:37.000
Among those keen to greet Willie is
a former All Black captain and the
chief of the NZ Army.

32
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.920
Meanwhile, his mother
chats to a familiar face.

33
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:48.560
Usually when you come to Parliament,
no one's there and it's about
2 o'clock in the morning.

34
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.440
(LAUGHS)

35
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:54.920
As the press arrive at Government
House, a very private ceremony is
already taking place inside.

36
00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.920
Ladies and gentlemen, Their
Excellencies the Honourable Anand
Satyanand and Mrs Susan Satyanand.

37
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.360
Three other medals are to be
awarded for acts of gallantry.

38
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.880
Each of you has, as members of the
1st NZ Special Air Service Group,

39
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.280
rendered distinguished
service to our country, NZ.

40
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.800
Quite often, a lot of our work is
not acknowledged, and nor should it
be.

41
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.360
But in this particular instance,
these individuals, representative
of the SAS group,

42
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.400
were being recognised and they had
the opportunity to be in a very
dignified way.

43
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.840
But the celebrations of today are a
far cry from the events of three
years ago.

44
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.200
During a tour of Afghanistan, an
NZSAS patrol was forced to lay up
for the night

45
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.080
in terrain that offered
limited defensive protection.

46
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.560
As the crew of Corporal
Willie Apiata's vehicle slept,

47
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.200
a small army of insurgents lay
under the cover of darkness

48
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.520
with rocket-propelled
grenades and machine guns.

49
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:14.840
If something's gonna happen, it'll
always happen when you least expect
it. And, hey. That's what happened.

50
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.680
BOMB EXPLODES

51
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.480
The whole car erupted,
basically, as the first RPG hit.

52
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.920
BOMB EXPLODES

53
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.480
I woke up standing up, with my
sleeping bag around my ankles.
Blown off the bonnet.

54
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.040
BOMB EXPLODES

55
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.680
You could feel all the over-pressure
coming off it, as well, plus all the
small arms in the background.

56
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.720
MACHINE GUNS FIRE

57
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.040
I just crawled as low as
I could to the vehicle.

58
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.080
MACHINE GUNS FIRE

59
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.800
The RPGs and machine-gun rounds
ripped through the vehicle
commander's arm.

60
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.840
I remember him looking for the entry
and exit and looking right through.

61
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.880
MACHINE GUNS FIRE

62
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.120
The three of us were at the
back of the wagon, pinned down.

63
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.160
The whole wagon was shaking.

64
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.960
The bullets ripping
through the metal.

65
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.600
MACHINE GUNS FIRE

66
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.200
RPG rounds hitting it after
that. One after the other.

67
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.800
MACHINE GUNS FIRE

68
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.280
BOMB EXPLODES

69
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.720
I sort of lost count on how many
rockets, I suppose, hit the wagon.

70
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.840
I think I might have
counted about five or so.

71
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.640
With support nearly 100m away,
the vehicle commander was rapidly
bleeding to death.

72
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.600
I can remember my body going into
peripheral shutdown and I can
remember my feet...

73
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.280
losing feeling in my feet as
the blood drains to your core.

74
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.880
Imagine turning a tap or hose on,
and the water splashing on the
ground.

75
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.360
As the enemy approached, the
NZers faced certain death.

76
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.600
I don't think anyone could have come
to help us. We had to get ourselves
out.

77
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.560
The moment has finally arrived
for Willie to receive the
Victoria Cross.

78
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.600
All right. >

79
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.720
On your lead, my liege.

80
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.760
Good luck.

81
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.400
There are two caveats placed
on awarding the Victoria Cross.

82
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.320
The first is a singular brave act
or deed. Secondly, the nature of
that act must be such

83
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.000
that it turned the tide of the
battle that was being conducted.

84
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.440
I also read that you have to
have a 90% chance of dying.

85
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.600
PIANO PLAYS 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN'

86
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:59.720
As Governor-General, I have the
authority and privilege on behalf
of Her Majesty the Queen >

87
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.840
to confer the honour of the
Victoria Cross for NZ >

88
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.120
on Corporal Bill Henry Apiata of
the NZ Special Air Service Group. >

89
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.760
You are the first person to
receive the Victoria Cross for NZ.

90
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:24.440
Corporal Bill Henry Apiata, NZ
Special Air Services, of Papakura.

91
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.480
Well done.

92
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.840
I'm very privileged to share
this special NZ moment with you.

93
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.760
You should wear it with great pride.

94
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.400
All the best to you.
Thank you, Your Excellency.

95
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.480
Tena koe.

96
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.800
When he pinned it on my chest, it
was like one of the heaviest things
I've ever carried, eh.

97
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.320
For such a small, small thing.

98
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.120
APPLAUSE

99
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.080
I felt very proud
that day, you know.

100
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:21.320
Things had finally sunk in by then,
and I just felt very proud for my
country.

101
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:28.640
Yeah, well, I've always been a man
of few words and I'm still trying
to get used to the press and that.

102
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.760
It's been a very emotional
and humbling experience today.

103
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:37.800
All the NZers out there that have
supported me and sent me all those
messages,

104
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:43.760
I'm still reading through them all
and I will read them all. They are
very heart-warming messages.

105
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.440
I've given up being
surprised by these guys.

106
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:52.080
Just when you think they're at the
level of their endurance or the
level of their capabilities,

107
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:58.440
they'll always come out with more,
so... In his particular instance,
he's done a fantastic job.

108
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:04.920
After a day surrounded by the
country's leaders, a proud family
gets a brief moment to themselves.

109
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.960
That is so precious.

110
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.960
Man, that's gonna be loaded by
the time you're finished...
(LAUGHS)

111
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.120
Hey, you're cutting the time, eh.
Yeah, no. I understand that.

112
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.440
You can say goodbye to them.

113
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.120
I love you, my brother.

114
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.800
Yeah, you look after yourself.

115
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.640
See you when you come home.

116
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Love you.

117
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.200
Love you too, sis.

118
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.800
Cheers, boss. Thanks.

119
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:44.000
And then, at the end of the most
important day of his life, Willie
is finally alone.

120
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:49.640
I was just, like, be at peace with
myself for just those few moments.

121
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.760
You know, and take in
all the day's events.

122
00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:01.360
Because even though it was the end
of the day, the journey wasn't over
yet.

123
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.880
If Corporal Willie Apiata thought
after receiving the Victoria Cross

124
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:18.920
he would quietly return to his
former life in the NZSAS, he was
mistaken.

125
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.200
The award brings great opportunity
and great privilege, but it also
brings tremendous responsibility.

126
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.800
Instead of resuming normal duties,

127
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:34.080
Willie and the Victoria Cross are
sent on a week-long publicity
road trip.

128
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:39.800
Everybody wanted to meet Willie,
wanted Willie to appear at events.

129
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:47.000
The launch pad for the tour is
Waiouru, the main training base
for the NZ Army.

130
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.800
Double march! Hup! Hup!

131
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.840
Already, the impact of Willie's
new celebrity status is apparent.

132
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:58.680
The corporal's accommodation is
upgraded to one normally reserved
for VIPs.

133
00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.840
When the CO said, 'We're crashing at
the Homestead, I was like, 'Whoa.'

134
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:09.520
I'm a lieutenant colonel. I don't
stay at the Homestead. It's not the
place a corporal would stay.

135
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.040
Normally, you'd be
in the barracks there.

136
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.080
BOTH LAUGH

137
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:22.320
At Waiouru Military Museum, Willie
literally comes face to face with
his new-found fame.

138
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.200
It's been amazing, the amount
of public interest in here.

139
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.040
We've had a couple of panels down
there for about six months. Hardly
anyone notices.

140
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.080
This has been up since last week and
certainly, the interest in it's been
amazing.

141
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.200
All will be transferred
permanently down to the main museum.

142
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.440
That's the Falklands and the Gulf.

143
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:45.160
The museum is home to
NZ's Gallantry Awards.

144
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:51.560
All the Victoria Crosses that we
hold here, but obviously, all real.
This one's Charles Upham's.

145
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.640
Willie's actions have placed him
beside the likes of Charles Upham -

146
00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.480
NZ's most famous double VC
winner - and Bernard Freyberg.

147
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:07.640
In these surroundings, for the first
time, this humble soldier is not
alone.

148
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.960
I don't see myself as a hero. Just
doing my job out there that day.

149
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.320
SCHOOL BELL RINGS

150
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:25.440
Next up - Palmerston North Boys'
High. The school has a proud
military past.

151
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:31.560
Many former pupils fought and lost
their lives during the two World
Wars.

152
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:40.480
We are absolutely honoured to be
visited by this delegation from the
SAS and Corporal Willie Apiata, VC.

153
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:46.600
He displays many of the qualities
dear to this school. His courage and
humility are an example to us all.

154
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.640
School stand. >

155
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.600
BOYS CHANT HAKA

156
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:20.600
This symbolic act of 1600 boys is
a heartfelt demonstration of the
groundswell of national pride.

157
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:26.040
And his companions are briefly
thrown into the world of
Willie Apiata, VC.

158
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.280
My gosh, you guys
make me feel special.

159
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.760
CO. There you go.

160
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.080
People are immensely proud
as a result of his decoration.

161
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.200
I'd like to introduce
you to my wife.
Kia ora.

162
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.640
It seems everyone wants a
moment with Willie Apiata.

163
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:49.640
Anywhere I go now, the garage or
corner dairy, people always come up
now. 'Hey, are you Willie Apiata?'

164
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:56.000
From playgrounds to parade ground,
Willie has brought much honour to
all ranks.

165
00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:03.000
Soldiers out there are just so
proud. This is a big lift for the
NZ Defence Force as a whole.

166
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.040
MEN CHANT HAKA

167
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.640
For Willie, an emotional
trip is nearly at an end.

168
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:27.200
The last port of call is the
Infantry Battalion's 50th
celebrations,

169
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.800
where he is to present
a special gift.

170
00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.680
APPLAUSE

171
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:38.120
It says, 'Corporal Willie Apiata,
VC - the 1st NZ Special Air Service
Group.'

172
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.320
APPLAUSE

173
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.120
To acknowledge what this really
means to us as a war-fighting
organisation,

174
00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.960
putting aside the political
correctness, we're talking about
killing the Queen's enemies.

175
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.240
The example of close combat and
the requirement of the bond between
soldiers is timeless -

176
00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.960
transcends the technology we
have. I thank you for this.

177
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:09.480
Soldiers fight for a reason. They
don't necessarily, in the heat of
battle, fight for Queen and country,

178
00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:14.000
or anything other than the
man on their left and right.

179
00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.440
MACHINE GUNS FIRE

180
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:26.440
In Afghanistan, three NZSAS soldiers
were trapped behind a burning
vehicle,

181
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.520
their commander bleeding to death.

182
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:33.080
I know enough about med through the
unit to know that it was an arterial
bleed.

183
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.400
Attempts to reach the first
aid only drew more fire.

184
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:42.560
Their chances of survival
were disappearing fast.

185
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:48.120
Soon as a vehicle like that has some
type of fire, it turns itself into a
lead magnet.

186
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.160
BOOM!

187
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.320
GUNS FIRE

188
00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:04.120
You could definitely see one of the
vehicles that had come up to support
us engaging quite hardcore.

189
00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.120
MACHINE GUNS FIRE

190
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:18.040
The vehicle was getting hit hard,
cos it was visible by the assault
force, which was only about...

191
00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.560
probably 25m away.

192
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:25.240
Things intensified to... Just had a
feeling if we stayed any longer, we
wouldn't last much longer.

193
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.280
We would probably all have
come home in a box.

194
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.720
MACHINE GUNS FIRE

195
00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:37.520
Their rate of fire had increased
even more and that was when Willie
decided, 'We're outta here.'

196
00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.600
Chucked him on my shoulder.
I said, 'Let's go, mate.'

197
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.160
Then we headed off back towards
where we knew our guys were.

198
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:48.760
It certainly never came into
anyone's mind that we'd ever
leave anyone behind.

199
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:54.400
Their only hope - run through the
firefight to the support vehicle.

200
00:16:54.640 --> 00:17:00.680
You just keep going till you...
either go where you wanna go or
you get dropped.

201
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:04.600
Running up that hill...
the ground was on fire.

202
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
MACHINE GUNS FIRE

203
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.400
Tracer whipping through the air.

204
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.680
I didn't feel no weight at all.

205
00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:22.760
Adrenalin pumping through your body,
just knowing you have to cover that
area to get him to safety.

206
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.720
I don't know how to really
explain it better, but...

207
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:37.920
you've got everything that you've
learnt from the moment you're born

208
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.360
up till that moment
flowing through your body,

209
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.560
trying to help you get out
of that situation alive.

210
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:59.560
Against unbelievable odds, Corporal
Willie Apiata made it unscathed

211
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:07.000
and delivered his wounded commander
to a waiting medic. But the battle
was far from over.

212
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:14.800
It's the end of the road trip,
and there's only one place
Willie Apiata wants to be.

213
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:20.240
It was what I've been waiting for,
eh - to come home, bring the medal
back to the unit.

214
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:26.080
Bring it back to the lads. And say
to them, 'Here, boys. This is for
us.'

215
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Whoo. Hey, boys.

216
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.600
Hey, brothers.

217
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.240
How's it going, bro?
Willie. Congratulations.

218
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.280
Congratulations, man.

219
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.640
Thank you, bro. Buddy.

220
00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.960
Hey, bro.

221
00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.320
Cheers, there, brother.

222
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.240
< So good to be in
here with a beer.

223
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:57.160
All these real formal things that
we've been to - this is the only
place I can let my hair down, eh.

224
00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.520
BELL DINGS

225
00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:05.480
Just like to say is, just kia ora to
everybody here, eh. Kia ora koutou.

226
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:12.920
I am proud and honoured to wear this
VC. It was- I didn't ask for it.
It was bestowed upon me,

227
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:20.480
and what my thoughts are is, I carry
it for us bros - the lads who were
there that day,

228
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:27.360
the lads that are here now, the ones
that are past and the ones that are
in the future.

229
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:34.400
Bros, it's so grounding to come home
because you fellas are my levellers.
You will always keep me the same.

230
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.120
And that's how I wanna be,
one of the lads with you fellas.

231
00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.960
So, tena koutou, tena koutou,
tena koutou katoa.

232
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.760
Cheers, brothers.
